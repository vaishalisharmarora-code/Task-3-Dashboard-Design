Task 3 Dashboard Design
Created an interactive Power BI dashboard using Amazon sales data from Kaggle.

Designed KPI cards to display key metrics, including sales, profit, and growth.

Integrated slicers to allow users to drill down into detailed insights for each KPI.

Applied a consistent color theme to enhance interactivity and visual appeal.

The dashboard effectively illustrated sales performance, profitability, and growth trends, supporting clear and data-driven presentations.
